# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling during database interactions.

The `bug.js` file showcases a route that fetches user data from a database.  It neglects to properly handle potential errors from the database query, leading to unexpected behavior if the query fails.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling, demonstrating best practices for managing asynchronous operations and database errors within an Express.js application.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (you'll need a database library).
3. Run the `bug.js` file (make sure your database is configured correctly).
4. Attempt to access a route that triggers a database error (e.g., an invalid user ID).
5. Observe the error response or unexpected behavior.
6. Compare to the corrected `bugSolution.js` file's response handling.
